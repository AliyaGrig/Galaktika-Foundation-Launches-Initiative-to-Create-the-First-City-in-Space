# Galaktika Foundation Launches Initiative to Create the First City in Space

The GALAKTIKA Foundation has set its sights on an awe-inspiring #project that could change the course of humanity's #future - creating the first city in #space! As part of this ambitious venture, Asymptote Architecture has designed the #Cosmos Center, a cutting-edge space facility that will house #educational, #scientific, #art, and #entertainment programs for space exploration.

Currently seeking a suitable municipality for its construction, the Cosmos Center is set to be an epicenter of #inspiration, #idea exchange, and #entertainment. Beyond that, it will also serve as a platform for higher learning, hosting forums and dialogues to disseminate new concepts and ideas related to space exploration. I envision the Cosmos Center as a place that unites people around the idea that space is indeed the future of mankind.

The architecture and design of the Cosmos Center are inspired by the #mathematics, #tectonics, and formations of carbon at the molecular level. This #innovative approach, influenced by carbon-based structures found on Earth, aims to encapsulate information, data, and the mysteries of humankind's inevitable interstellar existence. The unique and elegant architecture, designed by Asymptote Architecture, promises to attract visitors from all corners of the world, drawn by the allure of space exploration.
